## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Google account to access Google Sheets and Google Apps Script.

### Setup Google Sheets and Apps Script

1. **Create a Google Sheet**:

   - Navigate to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com) and create a new spreadsheet.
   - Copy the spreadsheet ID from the URL; you'll need this for the Google Apps Script.

2. **Create a Google Apps Script**:

   - Visit [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com) and create a new project.
   - Replace the default script with the following code:

   ```javascript
   function doPost(e) {
     var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById("YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID").getSheetByName(
       "Sheet1"
     );
     var data = e.parameter;
     sheet.appendRow([new Date(), data.Email]);
     return ContentService.createTextOutput("Success");
   }
   ```

   - Replace `'YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID'` with your actual Google Sheet ID.
   - Save and deploy the script as a web app, setting access to "Anyone" or "Anyone, even anonymous."

3. **Copy the Web App URL**:
   - Use this URL as `scriptURL` in your JavaScript code.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd subscribe-form-to-google-sheet
   ```

2. **Open the Project**:
